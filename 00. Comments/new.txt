Port Mapping Recommendations:

Service	Keep Port Mapping?	Why?
PostgreSQL	❌ No	Your Django backend and Celery connect via Docker's internal network (my_network).
Redis	❌ No	Celery and Django communicate with Redis internally via the Docker network.
Backend	✅ Yes (8000)	Needed for development access to Django REST API.
Frontend	✅ Yes (3000)	Needed to access the React app during development.
Nginx	✅ Yes (80/443)	Required to expose the app to users in production.
